                              Our engagement party was a success! Thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Clamor (Jenina's wonderful parents), we were able to have a dream engagement party surrounded by all the people we love. Thanks to everyone that were able to come out. It was a special time and reminded us of how fortunate we are.
                              Thank you especially the Jenina's parents, for opening your home and celebrating this special time with us. I am blessed and looking forward to having you as my in-laws.

                                    "The first time I saw Mike Chang was at the steps of the Michigan Union waiting for the start of a Pi Alpha Phi rush event. We were both 18 year old college freshmen getting ourselves into something we really had no business doing.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    Nevertheless, this process of brotherhood and hazing made me come to appreciate and cherish a then-thugged out FOB with whom I shared little to no common interest with. To this day we are still very little alike but it is through such adversity and conflict, like the U.S. Civil War, we have managed to fight and hate but eventually reunite under a loose banner of mutual understanding and reluctant friendship.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    Nevertheless, despite his impatient temperament and an obstinate personality based on cold logic and reasoning, Mike has managed to find the opposite in his life companion, his wife to be Jenina. While Mike may lack common courtesy and manners, Jenina's graceful smile can light up an entire ball room. While Mike's broken English and incorrect usage of common American idioms can create uncomfortable silence and eyebrow raises, Jenina has mastered the communication of comfort and compassion, traits so essential in a nurse.

                                 <p>
                                    Yes you may call it a companionship of Yin and Yang, of night and day, or of cold and hot. I'd like to call it a band-aid on a gushing wound or a much needed amputation of a badly infected toe.

Their work life crossed paths at one point where both of them were working for Cisco. They like to talk in geek, and celebrates everytime Mike gets a new job with a bottle of champagne at Straits. Albert likes to salvage items from Mike's electronic junk yard. Albert also likes to deadlift, squat, and eat.</p>

                                    They have gone through good and rough times together and were witnesses of each other's personal growths over the years. Gene has cooked plenty of Korean food for Mike. Gene has since moved back to Korea. They have remained friends after all this time. As a testament to their relationship, Gene is going to fly over to the US 3 times for Mike (engagement party, bachelor party, and wedding).

                                    Don't remember, but should have involved their parents

                                    <strong>When did they meet?</strong><br />
                                    1985
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Li-Wei is a honored guest from Taiwan, and Mike's eldest cousin, or Mike's Mother's Elder-Sister's Child.</p>
                                 <p> Mike remembers that everytime they saw each other in their childhood, the adults loved to stand us side by side and compare our heights. Li-Wei was a good 5-inches taller than Mike for most of Mike's life. Mike's memories of Li-Wei includes playing in the mud, Li-Wei's kindness in giving his Dragon Ball stickers collection, buying Crayon Shin Chan comics from the stores in Miao-Li. He is Mike's closest cousin, and Mike cannot be more grateful than having Li-Wei attend his wedding.

                                    Kevin met with Mike through their mutual friend Kharen. Kevin at the time was new to California and looking for a place to stay for his new job at Cisco systems. Kevin was Mike's roommate for the past year.

                                    As a well-to-do professional, he is one of the few friends that my parents liked (the rest being the ones listed here). They shared their passion for fitness and hip hop. Like Mike, Kevin has lived in multiple countries and states in his life. Mike found it incredible that they had so much in common, and attributed it to the fact that they are both half-Hakka. Kevin enjoys basketball and "rap-beefs."
