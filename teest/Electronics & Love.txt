Man fed up with job, watching everyone and everything into a robot.  A perm back implant so there's no back pain. 
Everyone is a zombie looking on their phone
Man smokes, pray, breaks free, back in time.  Sees lady on Bart. Falls in love. Everything relaxes. They find cool technology together like the chicken egg, Nintendo  
But he's on borrowed time, (a clock) he knows his time is up. He can't stand splitting from his partner (thuderous, tornado-like torment with horns, then silence, as men in black show). 
  Man enters house. Sees hidden away a mixtape from wife. Then he decides to rekindle with wife as note plays (90s rnb cord). Man puts on record turn around sees wife, music plays. Slow dance and they both cry.
  
  A story disguised as one about electronics but is about a love story and finding what was in the past. It just happened to intersect with the culture.
